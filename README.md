[00:12.85] I see a whiskey bottle rocking on a corner of an alley
[00:17.31] Rocking and rolling down like you
[00:21.58] I hear myself talking music
[00:23.96] Talking trash, talking dreams
[00:26.08] Over and over all through the night
[00:43.58] 
[00:30.14] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[00:33.68] (I hear the night)
[00:34.72] Am I becoming just like you?
[00:37.15] This what it's meant to be?
[00:39.27] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[00:42.31] (Do remember)
[00:43.15] I don't wanna, I don't know what to remember just can't go on
[01:13.65] 
[00:48.15] An ordinary day
[00:50.33] With me sweeping floors
[00:52.68] No changes, just a hole in my heart
[01:10.18] 
[00:59.04] It's calm after storm and I found out
[01:03.49] That you were the storm and you're blowing
[01:07.82] It's calm after storm and you were there
[01:12.85] Falling down into the circle of Karma
[01:31.35] 
[01:16.79] It's calm after storm and you left me
[01:21.25] Alone with a song that I'm singing
[01:25.53] I don't know what I'm feeling but I know this
[01:29.63] That I miss you
[01:37.13] 
[01:39.58] You know that I don't sleep but I'm closing my eyes
[01:43.75] I wanna hear your voice echo in my head
[01:48.45] Never cared much for others or did you
[01:51.87] Maybe?
[01:52.92] Or maybe?
[01:55.31] Just maybe?
[02:00.81] 
[01:56.91] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[01:59.94] (I hear you sing)
[02:01.26] Cat and the plant that you left me
[02:03.72] Tremble shaking in silence
[02:05.72] Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[02:08.94] (I remember)
[02:09.41] Is it rainy, gonna be windy keep on falling through the night
[02:39.91] 
[02:14.57] It's Sunday afternoon
[02:16.62] I hear the doorbell ring
[02:19.03] I run to see if it may be you
[02:33.53] 
[02:25.44] It's calm after storm can you hear me
[02:29.58] I'm still waiting here so endlessly
[02:34.25] It's calm after storm I'm all alone
[02:39.69] Is this my fate into the circle of Karma
[02:43.24] It can never be you
[02:45.39] It's all a dream
[02:47.67] I close the door
[02:55.67] 
[03:05.38] It's calm after storm and I found out
[03:09.98] That you were the storm and you're blowing
[03:14.40] It's calm after storm and you were there
[03:19.63] Falling down into the circle of Karma
[03:38.13] 
[03:23.47] It's calm after storm and I found out
[03:27.96] That you were the storm and you're blowing
[03:32.06] It's calm after storm and you were there
[03:37.31] Falling down into the circle of Karma
[03:55.81] 
[03:41.14] It's calm after storm and you left me
[03:45.62] Alone with a song that I'm singing
[03:49.97] I don't know what I'm feeling
[03:52.31] But I know this
[03:54.45] That I miss you
