Blinded by ambitions with out regret
Not ashamed of your selfishness
Bringing harm to others to help yourself
Just to fill the void of inferiority

You're planting the seeds of misery
You'll harvest the fruit of all you have done
Soon will come the time to face your hate
With Feeling of repentance you'll be crushing yourself

Returning the pain
Confronting the wrath of the evil you create
Your conscience brings answers to your "whys?"
You're facing your hate
Surrounded by your own darkness
All that you've done will now be turned against and back at you

Driven by your feelings of envy and rage
Arranging pieces at your command
Your actions turn against you
The feel of shame will be haunting you

Your arrogance is shattered there's nothing left
Everything that went up must come down
Not even repentance will save your self
Beg to be forgiven now the price you will pay

Returning the pain
Confronting the wrath of the evil you create
Your conscience brings answers to your "whys?"
You're facing your hate
Surrounded by your own darkness
All that you've done will now be turned against and back at you

All what you did it's coming back at you
Look into the mirror it's staring back hard
Time, time now is judging you
The circle of karma brings scourge and justice for all

Returning the pain
Confronting the wrath of the evil you create
Your conscience brings answers to your "whys?"
You're facing your hate
Surrounded by your own darkness
All that you've done will now be turned against and back at you
