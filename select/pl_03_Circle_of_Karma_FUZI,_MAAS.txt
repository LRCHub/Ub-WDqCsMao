I see a whiskey bottle rocking on a corner of an
alley
Rocking and rolling down like you
I hear myself talking music, talking trash,
talking dreams, over and over all through the
night
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ……(I hear the night)
Am I becoming just like you? this what it’s
meant to be?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ………(Do remember)
I don’t wanna, I don’t know what to remember
just can’t go on
An ordinary day
With me sweeping floors
No changes, just a hole in my heart
It’s calm after storm and I found out that you
were the storm and you’re blowing
It’s calm after storm and you were there
falling down into the circle of Karma
It’s calm after storm and you left me alone
with a song that I’m singing
I don’t know what I’m feeling but I know this,
that I miss you
You know that I don’t sleep but I’m closing my
eyes, I wanna hear your voice echo in my head
Never cared much for others or did you, maybe?
Or maybe? Just maybe?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ……(I hear you sing)
Cat and the plant that you left me, tremble
shaking in silence
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ………(I remember)
Is it rainy, gonna be windy keep on falling
through the night
It’s Sunday afternoon
I hear the doorbell ring
I run to see if it may be you
It’s calm after storm can you hear me I’m
still waiting here so endlessly
It’s calm after storm I’m all alone, Is this
my fate into the circle of Karma
It can never be you, it’s all a dream, I close
the door
It’s calm after storm and I found out that you
were the storm and you’re blowing
It’s calm after storm and you were there
falling down into the circle of Karma
It’s calm after storm and I found out that you
were the storm and you’re blowing
It’s calm after storm and you were there
falling down into the circle of Karma
It’s calm after storm and you left me alone
with a song that I’m singing
I don’t know what I’m feeling but I know this,
that I miss you
